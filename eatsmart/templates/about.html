<p>We love the food and restaurants in the Triangle!</p>

<p>How often have you read a great Yelp review for a restaurant only to walk in
and see that it's got a dismal public health inspection score? If you're the
kind of person who pays attention to those ratings (or maybe you don't, but
should!), this is the app for you.</p>

<p>NC Food Inspector is a brand new app designed to give citizens easy access
to public health scores at restaurants in our community. It was created by <a
href="http://codefordurham.com/">Code for Durham</a>, a non-profit organization
committed to building helpful resources for our community out of public
data.</p>

<p>For now, it's simple: map restaurants according to their public health
inspection scores. Eventually, we'd like to mash it up with Yelp and
<a href="https://www.bullcitybucks.com/">Bull City Bucks</a> to give an
uber-Durham score that's worthy of our "Tastiest Town of the South" status.
Give us feedback and keep coming back to see new iterations.</p>
